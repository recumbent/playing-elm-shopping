# Before you can even start

This is a learning exercise for me, so will attempt 
Just to begin needs a pile of things, this is my list:

* Git - because you always need version control and git basically won
* Visual Studio Code - nice editor, has plugins to support elm
* Node - because you have to have node to do anything nowadays and that includes elm...
* Yarn (for package management, instead of npm) to install elm

That's probably all... maybe...

To actually start

yarn global add elm

You should then be able to run elm --version

Installs:

- elm
- elm-make
- elm-package
- elm-reactor
- elm-repl

So make a folder:

elm-shopping

Navigate into that folder

Then initialise the repo (we always need version control)

git init

And the project

yarn init

yarn init v0.27.5
